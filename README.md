# Homework Assignment 1 - Cancer Risk in California’s East Bay

## Purpose of this project

This repository is analyzing patterns of **cancer risk due to toxicity in the air** in California’s **East Bay region** (Alameda, Contra Costa, and Solano Counties). Using data from the **EPA’s EJScreen**, this project focuses on the **spatial distribution of cancer risk** and its relationship with **demographic vulnerability**. Mapping these variables visualizes how environmental burdens, such as air pollution, are related to cancer risk, and they may disproportionately affect communities of color or low-income populations.
